		In this visualization, we have for each state the number of companies that have been registered and the business activity
		they are involved in. 

		From the collection of all these datasets for each state, it is interesting to observe that the majority of the companies
		have some correlation with the geo-graphic location of the state.

		For example :
		   in Goa the number of companies involved in trading is very high 
		   and for Karnataka which is quite in the interior the Business Services Sector dominates.

		   Most of the states with major cities have a dominant Business Services Sector

		   however, for Maharashtra it has a good balance of both trading and Business Services.

		 In terms of the plot between the paidup capital ( the capital as public shares -- [used average]) vs sector , 
		 the insurance sector and the Electricity, Gas and Water Companies have a very large paidup captial 

		 for states like Assam with abundant resources the Mining and Quarrying Sector has large  paidup capital.

		 Lower paidup captial could mean that the sectors haven't alloted a lot of allowed capital to public shares.

		<pre>
		In summary, We can infer that the geographic location, the availability of resources has influenced the number of companies
		established in a state and also has a considerable say in the dominant sector. The sectors which are often undertook by
		the government tend to have higher paidup capital.
